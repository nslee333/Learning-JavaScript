This is Programming with Mosh on YouTube. This JavaScript tutorial is less than an hour long, It's a bit short for my liking, I perfer to have one video where I can learn the majority of the content.

Mosh speaks clearly and actually talks in a way that keeps you engaged, alot of teachers speak in monotone, so I end up daydreaming sometimes, with Mosh that was not the case which was nice.
