# Learning-JavaScript

Hey There, This is my JavaScript notes as I learn the programming language, Here you'll find my notes as I go through tutorials and such.

I'll try to post the tutorial videos that I use, that way if you're learning yourself, you can follow my guide, and I'll explain roughly the reasons why I choose those videos over others.
